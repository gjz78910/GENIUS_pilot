"""Travelling‑salesperson route optimisation.

This module provides route optimisation for field engineer scheduling.
The main entry point is `find_optimal_route`, which finds the shortest
route visiting all destinations and returning to the start.

Currently `find_optimal_route` delegates to a brute‑force algorithm
that exhaustively enumerates all permutations.  It is suitable only for
small numbers of locations.

The TSP algorithm assumes that the engineer starts and ends at the same
home location and visits all assigned job locations exactly once.  The
distance between locations is looked up in the provided travel matrix.
