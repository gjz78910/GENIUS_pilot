"""Top‑level package for the scheduling tool experiment.

The `src` package contains all source code for the minimal viable
scheduling tool.  Subpackages are organised by concern: `models` for
data classes, `optimization` for algorithms, `scheduling` for the
orchestration logic and `features` for stubs that can be extended in
future experiment tasks.
